Hi, 

My name is Joshua Semana and this is my Google Homepage Project. 
In this project we are suppose to replicate the Google Homepage as close as
possible (visual wise). 
Pretty much we are suppose to use skills that include, using HTML tags 
and properties to move elements around the page. 
Things with CSS and using that to style the page to the best of our ability.
